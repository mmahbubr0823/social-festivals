04-Ans: B

Explanation : because when we call the function in console,  no argument is passed. So the parameter does not get any value and returns undefined .


05-Ans: C
Explanation : The array contains 0 that is a falsy value. When we loop through the array it gives an element but the condition checks whether the element is true or false. Since 0 is a falsy value, the count variable will be 0. And gradually 1 will be added for other elements of the array. Thus the count returns 3.
